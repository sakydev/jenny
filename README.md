# Jenny - A personal AI assistant 
A personal AI assistant that helps me get mundane tasks done. I have lots of information, code snippets, and commands scattered around that I sometimes can't find when I need them. Or when I do, some other thing breaks down eventually causing time waste.

Hence, I put together Jenny. This tool not only helps keep things organized but also makes the execution of tasks easier.

**Features** 
Following are the things Jenny can currently do. 

`random music` Plays random music from the music directory  
`play youtube`Search a video on YouTube in Chrome  
`download video` Download a video from 30+ sources  
`download audio` Download MP3 of YouTube video  
`download channel` Download the entire YouTube channel   
`convert video` Convert video to other format or audio  
`rotate video` Rotate video by any degrees  
`search torrent` Search a torrent across multiple websites  
`search images` Search images in the browser  
`sort directory` Sorts directory contents by file type and copies to another directory  
`set wallpaper` Set random wallpaper from the directory  
`startwork` Opens up tools needed for development   
`goto` Quickly jump to a folder  

This is an ongoing project. I'll keep adding to it as needed and also update this page.
