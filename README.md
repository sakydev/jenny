A personal AI assistant that helps me get mundane tasks done. I have lots of information, code snippets, and commands scattered around that I sometimes can't find when I need them. Or when I do, some other thing breaks down eventually causing time waste.

Hence, I put together Jenny. This tool not only helps keep things organized but also makes the execution of tasks easier.
